# Beholding the Jewel of Reality
# 1. Auspicious beginning
> So long as there are occurrences of spaces/hopes, Kamalapāṇi reigns supreme—he whose nature is incomparable bliss, who is an abode of riches, who is without any abode, whose consorts are the incomparable ten goddesses, who is with his consort, who brings about the attainment of welfare and happiness for the three worlds, and who is without degeneration.

Concerning the verse beginning '... incomparable', the syntax (*sambandha*) is as follows: 'Kamalapāṇi', [a *vyadhikaraṇabahuvrīhi*] meaning he who has a lotus (*kamala* = *padma*) in hand, i.e. the blessed Avalokiteśvara, reigns supreme (√*ji*). How is he characterised? He is called one whose nature (*rūpa* = *svabhāva*) is none other than bliss that is 'incomparable' (*anupama*), i.e. it is without a point of comparison (*upamārahita*) since there is nothing else that has the qualities of supreme excellence (*atipraṇīta*), greatness (*mahattva*), and steadiness (*sthāyitva*) so long as *saṃsāra* remains. How else is he characterised? 'Riches' (*śrī*) are the requisites/accumulations (*sambhāra*) of merit and knowledge, and he is called an abode (*nivāsa*) or locus (*āśraya*) for those. He is 'without any abode' (*anivāsa*) because, in pervading all in the form of the Dharmakāya, he lacks any fixed (*pratiniyata*) abode.

How else is he? He is called one who has as his attendants (*paricāraka*) 'consorts' (*vidyā*) in the form of the 'ten goddesses' (*devī*) beginning with Rūpavajrā and ending with Tārā. They are 'incomparable' (*nirupama*), i.e. they surpass all points of comparison (*upamātikrānta*), in that they have [the qualities] beginning with supreme beauty (*rūpa*) and youth (*yauvana*), the *rasa*s of amorousness (*śṛṅgāra*) and so forth, and great compassion (*mahākaruṇā*). He is present with his [own personal] consort (*vidyā*) who resembles him (*svābhā*), and thus he is said to be 'accompanied by his consort' (*savidya*). He is called ['one who brings about the attainment of welfare and happiness for the three worlds' (*tribhuvanahitasaukhyaprāptikāra*)]: he is one for whom there is the making of (*kāra* = *karaṇa*) the attainment (*prāpti*) or direct experience (*sākṣātkriyā*) of welfare (*hita*), i.e. the future benefit of being a buddha and the like, [and] happiness (*saukhya*), i.e. the temporarily benefit of being a universal monarch and the like, for the three worlds (*tribhuvana*), i.e. for the beings (*jana*) who reside (*vartin*) in the three worlds. He is 'without degeneration' (*avikāra*) because he lacks degeneration (*vikāra*) or change (*anyathātva*) insofar as, by lacking the quality that is complete *nirvāṇa*, his nature is that of non-abiding *nirvāṇa*. The Blessed One who is thus characterised reigns supreme.

For how long? Addressing this, he says 'so long as there are occurrences of spaces/hopes'. Spaces (*āśā*) are the ten directions, their nature being the sky. Alternatively, hopes (*āśā*) are the longings (*tṛṣṇā*) of all beings for the enjoyments of the world (*bhavabhoga*). Their 'occurrences' (*vikāśa*) are their opportunities (*avakāśa*) or functionings (*pravarta*) [respectively], which is as much as to say their comings into existence (*prādurbhāva*). So long as there are these [openings], the Blessed One reigns supreme, which is to say that he is superior to all [gods] such as Viṣṇu, Śiva, and Brahmā.

Here, by saying that he is one 'whose nature is incomparable bliss', the perfection of [Avalokiteśvara's] personal aims (*svārthasaṃpatti*) is expressed. By saying that he is 'an abode of riches', the means to that [perfection is expressed], because the word 'riches' (*śrī*) refers to the requisites of merit and wisdom (*puṇyajñānasambhāra*). By saying that he is one 'who brings about the attainment welfare and happiness for the three worlds', the perfection of the aims of others (*parārthasaṃpatti*) is taught. By saying that he is one 'whose consorts are the incomparable ten goddesses' and 'who is with his consort', the means to that [perfection is taught], because one is unable to bring about the perfection of the aims of others in every way (*sarvākāraparārthasaṃpatti*) without the forms (*ākāra*) of those kind of goddesses (*tathābhūtadevī*) and a body endowed with the thirty-two major signs and eighty minor marks.

# 2. The purpose of the treatise, etc.
> Employing seven divisions thronging with the teachings of various [teachers], I undertake the present effort to bring about clear understanding for those who indeed do not know the nature, devoid of [expression through] clear words, of the glorious Way of Mantra's beautiful fourth initiation. (2)

The words 'glorious Way of Mantra' (*śrīmantranīti*), although they can express the *yogatantra*s in general, [here] refer to the glorious *[Guhya]samāja*, since the meaning/content (*artha*) of the fourth [initiation] does not appear elsewhere. The rest [of the first half of the verse] one can easily understand. \[I undertake the present effort] by employing seven divisions (*bheda* = *prakāra*) thronging with (muddled with?) (*saṃkula* = *vyākula*) many (*gaṇa*) teachings (*upadeśa*) of various teachers (*nānācārya*)—i.e., they compile (*saṃgrāhaka*) a number of teachings (*upadeśarāśi*) known/belonging (*gata*) to teachers of the past, present, and future. \[I do so] 'to bring about clear understanding', i.e. for the sake of easily (*sukhena*) comprehending clearly (*sphuṭapratīti*).

# The reality and goal according to non-Buddhists
> All (*nikhila*) non-Buddhist philosophers (*tīrthya*) indeed (*hi*) have completely mistaken (*sambhrānta*) ideas (*bodha*) regarding the realisation of the nature (*rūpavitti*) of reality and the goal. People say that that the best among them are the Vedāntins, supposedly (*kila*) knowers of reality (*tattvavetṝ*). (3)

'Completely mistaken' and so forth: Non-Buddhist philosophers (*tīrthika*) are [here] called those whose 'ideas' (*bodha*), i.e. particular forms of insight (*prajñā*), are 'completely mistaken' (*sambhrānta* = *vibhrānta*).
Absolutely all of the non-Buddhist philosophers (*tīrthya*) have their intellectual eyes (*buddhinayana*) injured (*upahata*) by the eye diesease (*timira*) of grasping to the self (*ātman*) and its supposed belongings (*ātmīya*).
Thinking 'This is reality' and 'This is the goal', they are confused (*bhrānta*) regarding the 'realisation' (*vitti* = *pratīti*) of the nature (*svarūpa*) of reality and the goal.
The remainder is easy to understand.

\[Objection:] But since reality and the goal are one in nature insofar both are to be sought after (*upādeya*), how is it that they are treated differently [in the verse] when you say 'of reality and the goal'. 
This is incorrect.
For, even though reality is to be sought after, it pervades of the entirety (*saṃdoha*) of all appearances (*sakalapratibhāsa*), be they pleasant, painful, neutral, or otherwise.
On the other hand, the goal (*sādhya*)—being fruit (*phala*) characterised as a wish (*icchā*) though the exclusion (*vyāvṛtti*) of what is not wished for—is, although sought after, regarded surely ('*avaśyam eva*') by all sentient beings as what is to be accomplished (*sādhayitavya*) [only] through the exclusion of what is not to be accomplished.
Thus there is no fault.

# 4. The goals of Vedāntins, Śrāvakas, and Pratyekabuddhas
Now, first he teaches the goal held by the followers of Vedānta, beginning with '... bliss by nature'.

> The Vedāntins long for (√*vaś*) a goal that is self aware (*svavid*), bliss by nature, unmovable, and at peace. And the rhinoceros-jinas, as well as \emph{śrāvaka}s, desire as a goal the cessation (*virāma*) of the substrates (*upadhi*) of material form (*rūpa*) and so forth. (4)

\[The Vedāntin's goal is] 'bliss by nature' (*ānandarūpa*) because it is always comprised of/full of bliss (*ānanda*).
It is 'self-aware' (*svavid*) because, being in the form of a light (*jyotis*), it is illuminating itself.
It is 'unmovable' (*aprakampya*) because, in being permanent (*nitya*), it cannot be moved.
It is at peace (*śānta*) because it is conceived of as empty of major and minor mental afflictions.
[Vedāntins] 'long for' (√vaś), or desire, this kind of goal.

The rhinoceros-Jinas (*khaḍgajina*) who are alongside the *śrāvaka*s—namely, the *pratyekabuddha*s who live in isolation (*ekacārin*) or in groups (*vargacārin*) and who [are called *khaḍgajina*s because they] resemble rhinoceroses (*khaḍgaviṣāṇa*)—desire a goal.
What kind [of goal]?
The cessation of substrates—i.e., the cessation (*virāma*) or cutting off (*viccheda*) of the substrates (*upadhi*), i.e. aggregates (*skandha*), of material form, sensation, notion, formations, and consciousness—that is to say, their extinction. 
This amounts to saying the following: Even though *nirvāṇa* is divided into the types of 'with remainder of substrate' (*sopadhiśeṣa*) and 'without remainder of substrate' (*nirupadhiśeṣa*), all *śrāvaka*s and *pratyekabuddha*s have undertaken the goal of the *nirvāṇa* without remainder of substrate as what they should directly experience.

# 5. The four goals found in the Way of the Perfections
Now, beginning with 'empty of form', [the author] relates the four kinds of goals held by the followers of the Way of the Perfections.

> Followers the Way of the Six Perfections—namely, [the perfections of] giving and so forth—teach that the goal is \[either] (1) empty of forms (*ākāraśūnya*), of the nature of the sky and the moon (*gaganendurūpa*), to be realised by oneself (*pratyātmavedya*), having compassion as its essence; (2) the outflow of the giving and so forth that is adorned with the beautiful marks, which accomplishes aims (*arthakārin*) and is without [even] bliss; or (3) a blissful body adorned by the beautiful marks, enjoyed by the those abiding on the tenth stage and accomplishing the aims of beings (*sattvārthakārin*). (5 and 6)

## 5.1. The first goal taught in the Way of the Perfections
[This goal] is empty of forms that are variegated in nature, including blue, yellow, pleasure, and pain—i.e., it is formless (*nirākāra*).
For just this reason, it is called one that has a nature (*rūpa* = *svabhāva*) like that of the 'sky' (*gagana*) insofar as it is formless (*nirākara*) and like that of the 'moon' (*indu*) insofar as it shining forth (*prabhāsvara*).
That it is 'to be known for oneself' (*pratyātmavedya*) means that it is only to be known through reflexive awareness (*svasaṃvedyaikavedya*).
'Compassion' (*karuṇā*) is the state of having the desire to rescue (*abhyudharaṇa*) all beings (*sakalajagat*) from suffering and the cause of suffering.
[The goal] is called that which has just that [compassion] as its essence (*rasa* = *svabhāva*).

This amounts to saying the following: 
The goal that is expressed by the words of the pith instructions on the Perfection [of Insight] is empty of variagated forms such as blue and yellow, without appearances, unstained (*nirañjana*), like the sky, pure (*svaccha*), emdowed with great compassion as it accomplishes the aims of all beings, and to be realised by oneself.
This is the first [kind of] goal [taught] in the Way of the Perfections.

## 5.2. The second goal taught in the Way of the Perfections
[The beautiful marks] are beautiful and they are marks; they called the thirty two marks.
By them [this outflow/goal that they teach] is 'adorned' (*bhūṣita*).
It 'accomplishes aims' in that it has as its nature a dispotion (*śīla*) to accomplish the aims (*artha*) or purposes (*prayojana*) of beings. 
It is the 'outflow' (*niṣyanda*) of the ten perfections of giving etc., meaning that it is a fruit (*phala*) resembling [its cause, i.e. those perfection,] (*sadṛśa*) insofar as it arises (*prabhava*) from the [culmination] of excellence (*prakarṣa*) in them.
Because suffering (*duḥkha*) has previusly already been abandoned (*prahīṇa*), and because even bliss is absent [at that time], [the goal is] without bliss (*apetasaukhya* = *apagatasaukhya*) insofar as it has the nature of equanimity (*upekṣā*). 

This amounts to saying the following: the second goal [taught in the Way of the Perfections] is a body bearing the thirty-two major marks and beautified by the eighty minor marks—it benefits the entire world (*sakalajagadarthakārin*); through one's own power of repeated practice (*abhyāsa*) in the perfections of giving and the rest, it takes the form of a perfect and complete buddha; and insofar as it is free of bliss and suffering, is a nature which is equanimity.

## 5.3. The third kind of goal in the Way of the Perfections
'A blissful [body]' and so forth: [This goal] is present with bliss; thus, it is blisful (*sānanda*).
It is both blisful and a body (*aṅga*) adorned (*maṇḍita*) with the beautiful marks (*sallakṣaṇa*), 'enjoyed' (*sambhujyamāna*), i.e. lived off of (*upajīvyamāna*), through its teaching the Dharma.
By whom?
By the lords of the tenth stage, since it is out of the range (*agocara*) of those abiding on the remaining stages (*pariśiṣṭabhūmi*).
It comes down to saying that [this goal/body] is enjoyed by those who have reached the tenth stage (*daśabhūmiprāpta*), such as Avalokiteśvara and Mañjuśrī.

This amounts to saying the following: 
This goal is precisely like how, in a buddha realm (*samyaksaṃbuddhabhuvana*) called Ghanavyūha that is above the pure abodes (*śuddhāvāsa*), the Blessed One appears (√*cakās*) as long as *saṃsāra* remains (*āsaṃsāraṃ*) with a blissful form (*ānandarūpa*) and identical with the *sambhogakāya*—he is a fulfiller the aims of all beings by means of his emanations; his body unseen by even the *śrāvaka*s, *pratyekabuddha*s, and lords of the ninth stage, while instead (*param*) he is enjoyed through the hearing of the Dharma by *bodhisattva*s who are lords of the tenth stage.

## 5.4. The fourth kind of goals in the Way of the Perfections
> After completing all the qualities of giving and so forth, and after does all the tasks of a perfect buddha, there is also a goal, taking the form of cessation, that is the direct perception of the limit of reality. (7)

'Making replete' and so forth: On the basis that the are multipled or repeatedly practised, the perfections of giving and so forth are themselves qualities (*guṇa*).
After one completes (*saṃ-√pūr*) these [perfections], i.e. after one makes them replete (*paripūrṇa*), and after one also does all (*sakala*) those tasks (*kṛtya*) of a perfect buddha, i.e. his every (*kṛtsnya*) necessary action (*avaśyakartavya*), there is also the goal that is the direct experience of the limit of reality (*bhūtakoṭi*)—emptiness (*śūnyatālakṣaṇa*) whose nature is the cessation of all mind (*citta*) and mental events (*caitta*).
In this way a fourth goal is spoken of by those abiding on the Way of Perfections.

# 6. The seven kinds of goals in the Way of Mantra
## 6.1 The first kind of goal in the Way of Mantra
> They declare that the goal is the body adorned with the eighty minor marks that, while embracing the consort woman and acting for the sake of people, is by nature free of pleasure and pain and devoid of conceptualisation. (8)

That [goal / body] whose nature is a disposition (*śīla*) to embrace the consort woman (*svābhāṅanā*) is said to be 'embracing the consort woman' (*svābhāṅganāśleṣin*). 
It is devoid of conceptualisation (*apetakalpa* = *vyapagatakalpa*), which is to say it is conceptualisation free (*kalpanārahita*).
The remainder is easily understood. 
This is the meaning: the first goal [taught by the followers of the Way of Mantra] is a body that embraces his tightly-held (*samāliṅgita*) consort woman, which achieves the aims of beings, which is adorned by the thirty-two major marks, and which has a nature of equanimity.

## 6.2. The second kind of goal in the Way of Mantra
> A certain [authority] says that [the goal is] bliss devoid of the qualifier of the form of a personal deity. It is meditated on from the very beginning, and when it becomes vivid, it is called Great Bliss, which accomplishes the aims of beings like a wish-fulfilling jewel. (9)

'... personal deity' and so forth: [This goal / bliss] is devoid (*śūnya*) of the forms (*ākāra*) of a personal deity (*sveṣṭadevatā*), which is as much as to say that it is formless (*nirākara*).
One meditates (*saṃ-√bhū*) on bliss that is independent of deity forms (*devatākāranirapekṣa*) right from the beginning (*prāg eva*), immediately after [receiving] instructions (*upadeśānantara*).
Then, after one directly experiences [that bliss] by means of cultivation, it becomes called Great Bliss when it is vivid (*sphuṭa*)—i.e., when it is made to be vivid (*sphuṭīkṛta*).
And that [Great Bliss] 'accomplishes the aims of beings' in a form similar to a wish fulfilling jewel (*cintāmaṇisamānarūpa*).
This amounts to saying the following: the second goal is [the bliss that is meditated on] immediately after [receiving] instructions and is devoid of the forms of mantras, mudrās, and deities; which, having been made vivid through meditation, is called Great Bliss, serving the aims of beings like a wish-fulfilling jewel and remaining in the manner of an illusion (*māyopama*) for as long as there is *saṃsāra*.

## 6.3. The third kind of goal in the Way of Mantra
> After directly perceiving one's lord with the nature of bliss, one then abandons it, and [thus the goal] is a fruit that is mere bliss. The pure cannot be directly experienced; therefore, the form of one's lord is to be meditated on. (10)

'After directly perceiving' and so forth:
[First] one 'directly perceives' (*sākṣāt-√kṛ*), i.e. manifests before the mind (*āmukhī-√kṛ*), 'one's lord (*svādhipa*) with the nature of bliss (*sātarūpa*)', which is to say one's personal deity (*sveṣṭadaivata*) which has bliss as its only nature (*sukhaiasvabhāva*).
Later, once one abandons the deity forms (*devatākāra*), the goal is established to be the fruit as mere bliss (*sukhamātra*).

[Objection:] 'But if the deity's form is to be abandoned even after it's been directly experienced, then why is it meditated on right at first?
Why not meditate on just mere bliss as in the second goal?
What use is this meaningless effort (*vṛthāprayāsa*)?
Addressing this, [the author] says 'The pure' and so forth.
[At first] 'pure' (*śuddha*) or isolated (*kevala*) mere bliss (*sukhamātra*), free of the forms of a deity (*devatākārarahita*), cannot at all be directly experienced, because form-free (*ākārarahita*) bliss is not [even] perceived.
Therefore, for that reason, the form of one's own lord should be meditated on [in the beginning].
This is the third [goal].

The meaning is as follows: One meditates on bliss that is only [the kind] connected to the form of a deity. When it is becomes manifest, one abandons the deity's form and there is bliss alone, which is the goal endowed with the previously taught qualities.

## 6.4 The fourth kind of goal in the Way of Mantra
> Another says that the goal has a body equal to space and a body adorned with the marks. It is filled with incomparable bliss, joined with a personal consort, accomplishing the aims of all beings with limitless Buddha-sages who shoot forth, and empty of eradication.

[This goal is one] that has a 'body (*śarīra*) equal to space (*gagaṇasama*)', which like an illusion (*māyopama*) is unable to withstand critical analysis (*vicārāsaha*).
It is one that has a bodies (*aṅga*) adorned (*maṇḍita*) with the thirty-two marks and the eighty signs.
It is filled (*pūrṇa*), i.e. complete (*saṃpūrṇa*) up to the tips of the body's hair (*romāgraparyanta*), with 'incomparable (*nirupama*) blisses (*sukha*)'—which, lacking any point of comparison due to [their] largeness (sthaulya), uninterruptedness (*nairantarya*), continuity so long as *saṃsāra* remains, (āsaṃsārapravāhitva), and undefiledness (nirāsravatva), transcends [all] points of comparison.
[The goal] is one that is 'joined' with (*saṃgata*), i.e. is in complete union with (*samāliṅgita*), a personal consort (*svābhā*), i.e. [a consort] who is [also] like that (*tathābhūta*) [goal].
It 'accomplishes the aims of all beings' (*sarvasattvārthakārin*) with shooting forth (*sphurat*) and infinitely emanated (*anantanirmita*) Buddha-sages (*munīndra*), who are  [also] just like that (*tathābhūta*) [goal].
Of 'eradication' (*uccheda*), i.e. cessation (*nirodha*), it is empty (*śūnya*), free (*tuccha*), and devoid (*rikta*).

This amounts to saying the following:
Insofar as its nature is insight that is supremely subtle (*parasūkṣma*) and extremely profound (*atigambhīra*), it has the nature of the Dharmakāya: it is like space (*gagana*), an illusion (*māyā*), a mirage (*marīc*), a city of *gandharva*s (*gandharvanagara*), a moon in water (*udakacandra*), a reflection (*pratibimba*), and a dream (*svapnopamam*); it is devoid of a nature that is one or many, existence or non-existence, perceiver or perceived; it is without beginning or end (*anādyantam*); it has the nature of the entirety (*saṃdoha*) of all entities (*aśeṣavastu*); it is appearanceless (*nirābhāsa*), unstained (*nirañjana*), and surpasses all points of comparison (*sarvopamātikrānta*).
Insofar as its nature is vast (*udāra*) in its being infused (*saṃvalita*) with compassion, it has the nature of the Sambhogakāya: it has bodies (śarīra) adorned (*vibhūṣita*) by the thirty-two marks; it has forms (*gātra*) beautified (*virājita*) by the eighty signs; it is endowed with supreme eroticism (*śṛṅgāra*), youth (*yavana*), and so forth; its bodies (*aṅga*) are embraced (*āliṅgita*) by personal consort women (*svābhāṅganā*); and it is enjoyed (*sambhujyamāna*) like an reflection (*pratibimbavat*) by the group (*gaṇa*) of goddesses beginning with Rūpavajra and ending with Tārā through the enjoyment (*upabhoga*) of supreme bliss (*paramānanda*), the nature of which is signless (*animitta*) pleasure (*rati*) with countless variations (*anantaprabheda*).
Insofar as it causes the emission (*spharaṇa*) and withdrawal (*saṃharaṇa*) of buddhas and bodhisattvas belonging to countless emanated families `\[**what does nirmita qualify**]`, it has the nature of the Nirmāṇakāya in order to ripen (*paripācana*) beings to be tamed (*vineyajana*) of various preferences (*nānādhimukti*) through various types of miraculous displays (*pratihārya*).
It is filled with (*pūrṇa*) the true bliss (*satsukha*) arisen from (*sambhūta*) concentration on stainless insight and means, whose nature is *bodhicitta* that is inseparable from emptiness and compassion. `\[**again, bodhicittasvabhāva qualifies what?**]`
It has the nature of non-abiding *nirvāṇa*.
[And] insofar as has a permanent continuity like the flame of a lamp (*pradīpaśikhā*) that is without blemish (*nirmala*), undisturbed (*nivāta*), and unmoving (*niścala*), it is devoid of cessation (*nirodhaśūnya*). 
This is the fourth goal.

## 6.5 The fifth kind of goal in the Way of Mantra
> After one directly perceives one's lord with his blissful nature and then relinquishes him, there comes as fruit mere equanimous awareness. It remains as long as there is *saṃsāra* and accomplishes the aims of beings. Known as a wish-fulfilling jewel, it is entirely at peace. (12)

'After one [directly] perceives' etc.: After one directly perceives one's lord and later abandons him, there is as the goal awareness that is merely of a nature that is equanimity.
The rest is easily understood.
This amounts to saying the following: The fifth goal is, after one directly experiences the nature of the *maṇḍala* circle and later makes it cease, mere equanimous awareness.

## 6.6 The sixth kind of goal in the Way of Mantra 
> After one directly perceives the \emph{maṇḍala} whose nature is pleasure, later according to one's wish there is its coming to rest. Neither is there here an absence of [accomplishing] the aims of beings, since from cessation there is manifestation.

"After one directly perceives" and so forth: 
After one directly perceives the maṇḍala which is infused with pleasure (*sātasaṃvalita*), there is its coming to rest (*nirvṛti*), i.e. its stoppage (*nirodha*), according to one's wish (*svecchā*).

[Objection:] 'But if even after experiencing it one should later cause it to stop according to one's wish, then there would be an absence of compassion (*karuṇā*), which had been repeated cultivated (*abhyasta*) over a long time (*anekakāla*).
And because that is absent, there would be a lack of [accomplishing] the aims of beings.'
In view of this doubt, he says 'neither is there here an absence of [accomplishing] the aims of beings' and so forth.
[Here], according to this position ('*asmin pakṣe*'), there is not absence of [accomplishing] the aims of beings.
For, from the compassion-infused (*karauṇāsaṃvalita*) [maṇḍala]circle that had come to rest [the accomplishment of] the aims of beings [again] manifests (*prādurbhāva*).

By this he says exactly following: Having directly realized the circle that is completely full of bliss (*sātasaṃpūrṇacakra*), and having established it for as long a time as desired, afterwards one should remain (*sthātavya*) having caused [the circle] to completely cease like [putting out] a lamp. Then again, when there is the desire to benefit beings (*sattvārthābhilāṣa*), having produced another circle from the very [wheel] that was ceased (*niruddha*), one should perform the benefit of beings. Even in the production of another wheel, it is precisely freom the wheel that was stopped long ago that, in accordance with the suitability (*bhavyatā*) of beings to be trained (*vineya*), they attain what is desired (*abhilaṣitaprāpti*). 

## 6.7 The seventh kind of goal in the Way of Mantra
> Some say the fruit is cesation, [to be realised] later, after one makes clear a form that is desired among those [other positions]. And because cessation is not different in nature, even though there are different position, [cessation itself] has no distinction.

'... after one makes' and so forth:
Because any of the fruits from the six [previous] positions is a goal, one directly experiences precisely whichever one desires.
Later, one should directly experience cessation (*nirodha*) in every way that, like [the cessation] of a lamp (*pradīpavat*), is at a later time empty of [accomplishing] the aims of beings.

[Objection]: 'But owing to differentiation of six positions, there would be none other than six cessations.
How then is there only one *nirvāṇa*?'
Anticipating this doubt, he says '... not different' and so forth.
[Cessation] is called one whose nature is undevided (*abhinna*).
For, even if there is differentiation based on the characteristics of the six positions, there is no difference in cessation, because insofar as its only nature is absence, [all] cessation is the same.
The meaning is as follows: after directly experience any of the positions, later there is cessation in the form of the cutting of (*uccheda*) of its continunity (*santāna*).

# 7. Mistaken views regarding the fourth initiation 
## 7.1. The first mistaken view
> Some say that the fourth initiation is the tasting of bodhicitta subsequent to the teaching of the wisdom-knowledge [initiation]. This is inferior. Why? Because all effort in visualisations would be futile, because their result is obtained [at that time]. (15)

'Wisdom-knowledge' etc. Some say that after the teaching of the wisdom-knowledge (prajñājñāna) initiation, the taking (grahaṇa) of bodhicitta in the form of nectar with one's tongue (rasanā) constitutes the fourth (turya = caturtha) initiation. And that is 'inferior' (avara) or deficient, which is to say vile (hīna). Why is it inferior? Because all effort (prayāsa), i.e. that practices taught by the tathāgatas, carried out in the meditations on mantras, mudrās, and the forms of deities, etc., becomes futile. Why? Because the result - the fruit to be accomplished through visualization - is already established/attained at the time of tasting bodhicitta, meaning there is no other superior result to be achieved."

## 7.2. The second mistaken view
> [Some] say that the fourth initiation is the enjoyment (*āsvāda*) of women (*rāmā*) who are met with after the wisdow-knowledge [initiation]. This is reprehensible (*adhama*). For, all of the efforts in meditation and the like taught by the Buddha would end up being useless. (16)

'Wisdom' and so forth.
The fourth (*turya*) initiation (*seka*) is the enjoyment (*āsvāda*) through union (*samāpatti*) of women (*rāmā* = *strī*) met with, i.e. as encounted, at a time after the wisdown-knowledge [initiation].
This too is reprehensible.
The rest has already been understood.

## 7.3. Explanation of the scripture
Now 'The fourth is that again in that way' is explained.
'The fourth' is called the fourth in reference to the prajñājñāna initiation, which is the third.
'That': With the word 'that', just that *prajñājñāna* [initiation] is referred to having that nature of the [fourth].
'Again': With the word again, a difference from that [*prajñājñāna* is expressed].
And here, the difference is characterised by a being in flow that is undefiled (*anāsrava*), unexcelled (*niruttara*), developed to the extreme (*atyantasphīta*), and unbroken in its continuity. 
'In that way': The words 'in that way' directly express similarity (*tādṛśatva*).
And similarity is that just as the *prajñājñāna* has arisen with through certain requisites (*sāmagrī*) that include (*yukta*) a *prajñā* and so forth, so too later [the Fourth arises] just that with, with just those sorts of requisites. 

And here one should understand the meaning based on a mark-marked relationship.
By it something is marked; hence, the *prajñājñāna* is the mark when it is experienced.
For, given the principle that 'there is no cognition of the qualified (*viśeṣyabuddhi*) without having grasped the qualifier (*agṛhītaviśeṣaṇa*)', it cannot be a mark without being experienced.
By this [marker] it is marked, known, or made known; hence, fourth, which is about to be directly experienced, is the marked.

## 7.4 The third mistaken view
Here some say that there is no fourth.
[And if one says:] 'But there exists a word for the [fourth], namely this: "The fourth [is that again in that way]".
So how can you say it doesn't exist?'
True, for the sake of the protection (*saṃrakṣā*) of the pith instructions (*upadeśa*) and in order to bewilder (*vyāmohana*) ordinary beings (*sattva*), the Blessed One used the word 'fourth' to teach none other than the third.
Otherwise, he would have said 'that again'.

This is completely incoherent.
The fourth, which is established by reliable knowledge, has been taught and is about to be taught.

## 7.5 Investigation of the target
Now, the marker, the *prajñājñāna*, is of course known by all.
On the other hand, there is confusion (*vyāmoha*) about the marked. 
Therefore, it is analysed [here].
For, the marked should either have the nature of an external object (*artha*) or that of awareness (*jñāna*).
In the first case, it does not have the nature of an external object, because external objects themselves do not exist, given that, insofar as they are free of (*viyogin*) [a nature that is] one or many, [external] are refuted by valid knowledge.
And because in the Way of Mantra, it is only the views of the Vijñānavāda and Madhyamaka that predominate, the marked may [be said to] have nature of awareness.
And awareness is either with (*sākāra*) or without forms (*nirākāra*).
And [awareness] with forms is either has a non-dual variegated nature (*citrādvaita*) or a manifold nature (*anekarūpa*).
These are the options (*vikalpa*).

## 7.5.1. Refutation of consciousness with forms
Of these [options], the of the Nirākāra position say that consciousness (*vijñāna*) with forms (*sākāra*), like flowers in space (*gagaṇakamala*), does not exist in any way (*sarvsthaiva*).
[Objection:] 'But forms appear having the to perception (*pratyakṣatas*) in the form of blue, yellow, and white etc., and pots, cloths, and carts. And those [forms], owing to the non-existence of external objects (*artha*), must have the nature of none other than consciousness.
So, how can [consciousness] with forms not exist?'
True, forms certainly appear, but in a false form.
Their having a false form is established by their being devoid of [a nature] that is one or many, a fact that is characterised by valid knowledge.
And this [fact] having the nature of valid knowledge I have taught elsewhere; hence, here it will not be elaborated on.
And these forms, which like an illusion are established to be false, appear in the form of error (*bhrānti*).
And when there is cessation (*nivṛtti*) of error, [consciousness that is] entirely formless like a pure crystal remains established (*siddha*) as ultimately existent (*pāramārthika*).
Therefore, the two options are dispelled that consciousness with forms exists which is either variegated non-dual in nature or manifold in nature.

## 7.5.2. Establishing consciousness that is formless
[Objection:] 'Consciousness without forms too is not even observed in dreams to meet the conditions for perception (*upalabdhilakṣaṇaprāpta*).
So how can you say that it exists ultimately?'
The response is as follows:
Consciousness with the form of pleasure is indeed experienced being without forms, its nature bursting forth/manifesting (*parisphurat*) internally (*antar*).
As for the forms of blue and the like, they appears being false.
Otherwise, were they to be real, absolutely all forms would be real.
To explain: even, for example, the dichotomy of perceiver and perceived would be real, and, due do that, it would follow that absolutely everybody would have liberation given the real appearances [of all forms].
For, false appearances that erroneous in nature would not appear to anyone. 
And it is taught:

> Reality should be seen according to reality. Seers of reality are liberated.

Therefore, even unwillingly, the forms of blue and the like should be accepted to be false.
[Consciousness] with pleasure and the like, which is [in fact] formless, is perceived to be real.
So how is it not perceived [at all]?

[Objection:] 'But a consciousness that has the forms of pleasure and so forth is observed to be none other than [a consciousness] with forms, becuase pleasure and the like are forms in nature. And it is not the case that a cognition empty of the forms of pleasure and the like is perceived, even in a dream. And even in saying, "On the eighth stage [formless cognition] meets the conditions for perception because from it all error has passed away", there is no reliable knowledge that establishes the existence [of such a cognition], apart from you drinking the pledge water.'
This is wrong, because you have not understood the intention, since we assert that consciousness that only has forms of pleasure and so forth and that is devoid of the forms of blue and so forth is formless.
And all sentient beings have that right here and now, established by the valid knowledge of self awareness (*svasaṃvedana*).
So how is it now perceived?

### 7.5.3. Establishing the Madhyamaka position
[New position:] 'But that [formless cognition] too, because it lacks a nature that is either unitary or manifold, is entirely false (*alika*), mere error (*brāntimātra*).
For, being without a nature that is unitary or manifold is a pervading property (*vyāpin*) of consciousness [both] with and without forms.

[Objection:] 'By this principle, because the falseness of all consciousness, whether with or without forms, is established, ultimately there exists no object-reality whatsoever.
So how can the nature of the marked be characterised (*upalakṣayitavya*) through valid means of knowledge?'
This is not a fault, for in the Madhyamaka view, even though its falseness is established by a valid means of knowledge, mere illusion-like appearance, devoid of a nature that is unitary or manifold, is not refuted as a property possessor.
And in that very false mere appearance, the individual establishment is unimpeded for the marked and marker, *saṃsāra* and *nirvāṇa*, meditations on the maṇḍala circle etc., and the accomplishment of the aims of all beings.
And as it is taught:

> One accomplishes the state of a buddha, that of Vajrasattva just conventionally.

[Objection:] But all types of things are, insofar as they are false, pointless (*niḥsāra*). In that case,why make the effort of meditating on the *maṇḍala* circle and so forth? That is incorrect, for it is said:

> Even though there is no person who is liberated (moktṛ), there is effort to remove false superimposition.

Even though there is no ultimate (*pāramārthika*) nature of entities (*vasturūpa*) when analysed (*vicāryamāṇa*), all sentient beings (*sakalaprāṇabhṛt*) still have the longings of 'May I be happy' and 'May I not suffer'.
For example: even though good (*śubha*) and bad dreams (*aśubha*) are equally (*tulya*) false (*mithyā*), one is pleased (*saumanasya*) after one sees a good dream, and one is upset (*daurmanasya*) after one sees a bad dream and engages (*pravṛtti*) in [activities] such as reciting the scriptures (*saddharmapāṭha*) and repeating mantras (*mantrajāpa*).
Similarly, even though there is no difference (*aviśeṣa*) [in anything] in its being false (*mithyātva*), in order to eliminate ordinary conceptual thought (*prākṛtavikalpa*) of suffering and so forth, and in order to attain the characteristics of perfect awakening, reflective people (*prekṣāvat*) who desire a goal become active.

# 8 Evaluating the seven types of goals
[Objection:] But the purpose for which this discussion was begun has been lost.
To explain: the consideration of the marked and marker was introduced here, and that has been forgotten—it's not known where it has gone.

Didn't I finish that already with the seven divisions?

True, but there's the *guḍa* and *gorasa* principle.
To explain: we do not know which is the best and which is not. 

I will address this:

## 8.1. The problem of with the first
Because it lacks the sequence established in the Way of Mantra, because meditation on union (*samāpatti*) would be in vain, and because it lacks reasoning (*yukti*) (?), the first [*sādhya*] is worthless.
To explain: that which has complete causal requisites will definitely happen.
Otherwise, [if it does not happen], it is not indeed complete in its causal requisites. 
In the state of direct experience [of the fourth/the goal], That [i.e., bliss] is replete with its causal requisites.
So, That must necessarily be there.
Being there, the first [goal] is refuted.

## 8.2. The problem of with the second
Because it is not perceived (*anupalabdhi*) to have the nature of isolated bliss (*kevalasāta*), empty of the forms of bodies and so forth, the second [goal] is without merit (*sāratā*).
To explain: A reflective people (*prekṣavat*) will meditate on what is confirmed (*niścita*) by valid means of knowledge and not just anything whatsoever (*yathākiñcit*).
And at all times, it is only [a goal] whose nature is embraced by a valid means of knowledge that is perceived.
Just that appears to sentient beings as desirable (*kamanīya*).
Therefore, because there is no desire (*ruci*) for the isolated (*kevala*), because it is not perceived to be embraced by the forms of the [*maṇḍala*] circle,and because it cannot be directly experienced, the second [goal] is just an imaginary idea.

## 8.2. The problem of with the third
Because one cannot abandon that which has become a part of it as some that by nature is an irrefutable real thing, and because that whose nature is intermixed (*saṃvalita*) lacks division, and because there is no purpose [for abandoning part of it], the third position is not good.
To explain: when [two things] are established to be identical because they are [always] perceived together (*sahopalabha*), if one is cast aside, the other one too will certainly be cast aside—otherwise, neither is.

## 8.2. Evaluating the fourth
Because, owing to its manifoldness (*prapañca*), it involves a lot of effort (*bahuprayāsa*); and because, owing to its inability to withstand analysis (*vicārāsaha*), it is has the nature of error (*bhrāntirūpa*) and not that of ultimate reality (*paramārtha*), the position following the third (*tṛtīyāntapakṣa*) is not good (*kalyāṇa*).
About this some people (*kecit*) describe (√*varṇ*) [the aforementioned] reasoning (*yukti*) [as follows]:
Even in the absence of manifoldness, until through repeated meditation on the subtle (*sūkṣma*) (namely, the drop(s) and so forth) there is direct experience (*sākṣātkaraṇa*) [of the goal], effort applied to the objects of meditation is everywhere (*sarvatraiva*) present (*sam-√bhū*).
If one is afraid of effort in this case, then nothing whatsoever should be meditated upon.

[Objection:] `[The fourth goal is invalid] because it involves manifoldness (*prapañcarūpa*).'
[Response:] During the meditation state (*bhāvanāvasthā*), what is the difference between the manifold (*prapañca*) and the non-manifold (*aprapañca*)?
[Objection:] `The difference is that the non-manifold (*aprapañca*) more quickly becomes stable (*sthira*).'
Once the mind will become stable with respect precisely whichever object (*ālambana*) it is continuously (*nirantara*) and for a long time (*dīrghakāla*) directed on (*pra-√īr*). 
About this there is reasoning and scriptural citations.
As it is taught:

> Precisely whatever is meditated on, whether real or not, will have as its result a clear, non-conceptual cognition when meditation becomes powerful. 

Also:

> Oh the laziness! Oh the foolishness! Oh these people's distortion of true meaning! For, that Buddhahood, which is tied to their own mere minds, is not served/pursued (na sevyate), though it resides so near.

Therefore, this is not the difference.

Also, the ultimate unreality due to [everything] having an erroneous nature exists in all objects of meditation and in [all] objects, and so [if you criticize the goal on this ground], there would be nothing at all to meditate on.
And therefore, meditation in the path to liberation would be in every case useless.
If you say that 'What is being meditated upon from the non-manifest, although erroneous in nature, becomes flawless through engaging in meditation in accordance with forms being illusion-like,' [we respond that] this engagement with illusory forms is the same for the manifest world as well; so in that case too, where is the opportunity for fault?
Therefore, whether manifest or non-manifest, whatever appeals to you—whether it is consistent with valid means of knowledge or not—that alone should be meditated upon by those who seek the great human purpose, abandoning laziness.
Enough digression!

But regarding [this position], discerning whether it is valuable or not is to be known only by those who worship a guru.

## 8.5. The problem of with the fifth
Because it has the faults stated for the third position, because, insofar as it is insipid (*nīrasa*), it lacks purpose (*prayojana*), and because it lack the stages of the Way of Mantra, the fifth [position] is not without faults.

[Objection:] 'But there is the application of the Way of Mantra prior to directly experiencing [the goal].'
[Response:] True, what is to be accomplished is the state of the direct result (*sākṣātphala*), and in that [state], these stages [of the Way of Mantra] are[, according to you,] not directly present.
And if [these stages] are abandoned (*parityāga*), we do perceive any purpose (*prayojana*) [in this goal].

## 8.6. The problem of with the sixth 
Because it cannot be caused to cease by one's own desire (*svecchā*); because there is no purpose [to stopping it], and because it would lack [the accomplishment of] the aims of beings, the postulation (*kalpanā*) of the division (*prabheda*) following the fifth [division] is not devoid of defects (*kalaṅkā*). 
To explain: the cessation (*nivṛtti*) of something occurs either through the cessation of its cause (*kāraṇa*) or the cessation of a pervading factor (*vyāpaka*).
And in this case (*atra*), no terminating cause or pervading factor of the directly experienced *maṇḍala* circle is observed (*√dṛś*) at the time of the desire (*icchā*).

[Objection:] 'But there is none other than emptiness which terminates.
Just as fire that is ablaze in a mass of firewood reduces all of its fuel to dust and later ceases of its own accord, so the fire of emptiness ablaze in the *maṇḍala* circle, after making it visible, causes the *maṇḍala* circle to cease.'
[Response:] That is incorrect because the example (*dṛṣṭānta*) does not incongruous (*viṣama*).
To explain: in [the example], fuel is the cause for fire.
When the cause—namely, fuel—ceases, the cessation of the effect (*kārya*)—namely, fire—is only fitting (*yukta*).
Here, however, emptiness is not cause of the *maṇḍala* circle.
So how can there be cessation [of the *maṇḍala* circle] upon the cessation of that [emptiness]?
Nor is there cessation for emptiness.

[Objection:] 'But it is not a cause; rather, emptiness is a pervading factor.
When the pervading factor—namely, the tree—ceases, the pervaded—namely, the *śiṃśapā* tree—ceases.
Like that there is cessation.'
That too is without merit (*asāra*).
To explain: emptiness is forever a pervading factor of the *maṇḍala* of all knowable objects as their reality.
But it is not the case that there is ever its cessation.
If there were, then there could be cessation before or immediately after the direct experience of true and perfect awakening.
And that is not the case, because you yourself accept that after becoming a complete and perfect buddha one remains for a certain amount of time.

'But emptiness too has the nature of awareness, as does the circle.'
If there is cessation of the awareness of the circle by the arising of awareness of emptiness, then by what is awareness of emptiness to be arrested?
And cessation by that [awareness of emptiness]—because there is nothing opposing opposing, and because there is no cause of pervasive factor [governing it]—does not exist.
Therefore, there is no cessation of awareness of emptiness, nor is there cessation of the *maṇḍala* circle by emptiness; hence, emptiness is not that which terminates.

> Inexpressible oceans of happiness [arise for \emph{bodhisattva}s] when sentient beings are liberated. One may ask if those [oceans of happiness] alone are enough, but what would is the use of [any further] liberation that is without [such] relish?

[Accomplishing] the aims of beings is also absent in cessation.
For there can be no purposeful activity / function (*arthakriyā*) to the sky (*gagana*) or sky lotuses (*gaganakamala*).
It is also meaningless to say [the accomplishment of] the aims of beings comes from the circle, even though it ceased a long time ago, it belongs to the past (*atīta*), and it is a non-entity (*avasturūpa*).
For it would absurdly there would be crows (*kaṇṭhadvani*) from a rooster (*kukkuṭa*) that has long been mute (*ciranīruta*).

[Objection:] 'But there can be purposeful activity from the sky based on a yogins empowerment.'
That is not possible, because [the purposeful activity] is from the yogin empowerment alone, which has the nature of mind; it is not from the sky, because that is formeless (*nīrūpa*).

[Objection:] 'After causing the *maṇḍala* circle to cease, one produces it again at the time of [needing to accomplish] the aims of beings.
Therefore, there is purposeful action.
After that it once again is made to cease, and one again produced.'
This is not correct:
Just as the action for the purpose of sentient beings does not manifest from reality [on its own], so the [*maṇḍala*]-circle [too does not manifest from reality on its own].
Therefore, there is no possibility of purposeful action, nor is there any purpose in causing [the *maṇḍala* circle] to cease and then producing it again.
That is enough for this detailed discussion.

## 8.7. The problem of with the seventh
Owing to the mass (*sandoha*) of faults (*doṣa*) mentioned regarding the sixth position also applying to the seventh, I will not beat a dead horse (*piṣṭapeṣaṇa*).
[Objection:] 'But if the seventh is equal to the sixth [in terms of its faults], [then] how is the seventh different from it?'
There is a difference: in the state of the former, there are the forms of a certain fixed circle; later, there is its extinction based on one's will and production based on one's will. 
In the seventh [position], however, that does not exist.
therefore, they are not the same, and [the seventh position] is taught as something different (*bhinna*).

# 9. The nature of the fourth initiation
> [Agricultural metaphor:] The crop (*sasya*) that is the fourth (*turīya*) reaches fruition (*paripāka*), its flourishing (*puṣṭi*) arising (*bhūta*) from a sprout that, like (*bhūta*) a pure lotus, washed (*dhauta*) by a stream (*sruti*) from a thunderbolt's seed (i.e., a cloud).

> [Tantric meaning:] The crop (*sasya*) that is the fourth (*turīya*) reaches fruition (*paripāka*), its flourishing (*puṣṭi*) arising (*bhūta*) from a sprout (*aṅgkura*) arising in (*bhūta*) the pure (*śuddha*) lotus (*pāthoja*) [of the consort] that is washed (*dhauta*) by the stream (*sruti*) of the seed (*bīja*) of the vajra.

> [Tantric meaning:] The crop (*sasya*) that is the fourth (*turīya*) reaches fruition (*paripāka*), purified by washing with a stream of the vajra's seed, its development (*puṣṭi*) born (*bhūta*) from a sprout (*aṅgkura*) arising (*bhūta*) in the lotus (*pāthoja*), 


> The vivid fourth is hiden to even the learned.

'... the vajra' and so forth.
This is to be known from the instructions of a genuine teacher.

# 10. Other false goals and realities
> One should deduce on one's own that the following do not have the nature of reality: the five 'lamps', the five nectars, the drop, and the moon; the *maṇḍala*s arising from a drop between the eyebrows;


'The five "lamps" and so forth:
Some hold the goal to be none other than the constance performance [of partaking in of substances] marked by [the letters] *gokudahana*, as indicated by the word 'the five lamps', and marked by [the letters] *vimumāraśu*, as indicated by the word 'nectars'.
'The drop' indicates that some meditate the drop situated on the moon in the heart that shines brightly (*dedīpyamāna*) on the basis that it is both reality and the goal.
'The moon' indicates that some meditate on a form of a portion of the moon or a half moon in the heart situated on a lotus.

'The *maṇḍala*s arising from a drop between the eyebrows' are the *maṇḍala*s—namely, wind, water, earth, and fire—which arise from a drop that one has meditated on 'between the eyebrows', i.e., at the glabella (*ūrṇā*).
This amounts to saying the following: after the mouth, ears, eyes, nose, and tongue with ones fingers, one should visualise a drop between the eyebrows.
When that reaches a vivid state, the *maṇḍala*s of the earth and so forth will arise as indicators (*saṃsūcaka*) of good or bad signs (*nimitta*).
And they regard this drop as reality.

'The nature of wind' indicates the nature that is filling, holding, releasing, and resting, as well as inhalation and exhalation.
This amounts to saying the following: after coming to know the nature of wind (*vāyusvarūpa*) as taught (*nirdiṣṭa*) by the Śaivas, Sāṃkhyas and so forth, the proponents of wind stabilise that wind through cultivating its arrest (*nirodha*). They they realise travel by flying in the sky and entering other 'cities', all the way up to liberation.

Regarding 'uvula' and so forth:
In the region of the throat, above the base of the tongue, there is the uvula, also called the secondary tongue (*upajihvā*), in the shape of an elephant's trunk (*hastiśuṇḍika*) and hanging upside down (*adhaḥpralambamāna*).
And that has the nature of Śakti, with the reality below it having the nature of Śiva.
And when it is touched by the tongue, it drip continuous nectar.
And with this shower of gurgling nectar one should focus on the self being complete satiated.
This is the reality of the uvula.
The word 'and so on' refers to, for example, the Śiva-nature that is the reality to be meditated on in the form of awareness that resides in the middle of a cakra with sixteen spokes / channels in the centre of the heart.

All of this, regarded by the non-Buddhist philosophers as having the nature of reality, is non-reality—this one oneself should deduce, which comes down to saying one should carefully conclude.

# 11. Conclusion
> [Indicated] by the words expressing similies—dream, magical illusion, reflection; mirage, gandharva city, water-moon; and others—no [separate] goal exist at all other than what has here been taught. (19)

Regarding 'Dream' and so forth:
With the words 'like a dream, magical illusion, and reflection' and 'like a mirage, gandharva city, and water-moon'; also by other words, such as 'like the sky, like an echo, and like a bubble'—[indicated] by these direct expressions of similies (*upamābhidheya* = *upamavācaka*), no goal (*sādhya*) at all exists apart from the goals that have been taught [here].
Rather, it is to precisely the goals taught here that these words apply—this one should understand on one's own.
